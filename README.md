# My-Drosera-unique-trap
Trap for Drosera node, which is detecting exact amount of incoming tokens and if it's equal to pre-defined, it will trigger event.

## How It Works

- collect() records the current balance of the target wallet.  
- shouldRespond() compares the latest balance with the previous one.  
- If the balance increased by 0.0000777 ETH, the trap returns true.

## Deployment
   - Add the contract to your drosera.toml configuration under [[traps]].
   - Compile the contract with drosera build.
   - Apply the configuration with drosera apply.
   - Start your operator and monitor the dashboard/logs.
When the target wallet receives 0.0000777 ETH, the trap will trigger and show a dark green block in the dashboard.

## LogAlertReceiver

In addition to the trap itself, we also provide an example alert receiver contract called LogAlertReceiver.sol.
Its purpose:

   - To listen for alerts generated by the trap
   - To emit on-chain log events when the trap condition is met
   - To make it easier to test and debug trap execution results

Typical usage:
   - Deploy LogAlertReceiver alongside the trap
   - Configure Drosera so that alerts from the trap are delivered to the receiver
   - Watch emitted logs on-chain or in your node logs
